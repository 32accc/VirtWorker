Paul Mozzino was working an afternoon shift at a Trader Joe’s grocery store in Chico, Calif., last week when he heard a chorus of phones pinging simultaneously with alerts about a nearby wildfire.

“Oh God, not again,” Mr. Mozzino, who had evacuated from a fire before, recalled thinking at the time.

Later that day, he learned that his home in Humboldt Highlands was under an evacuation order. So he packed his favorite guitars and enough clothes to last him roughly a week, and hit the road. After driving just a mile, he looked over the ridge and saw a fiery red landscape.

"Trader Joe's employee Paul Mozzino thought to himself, 'Oh God, not again...' as wildfire alerts flooded his phone on the job. And by 'again', he meant another fire was threatening to burn down his house... which happened. Time to grab guitars and go! (Side note: who packs guitars during an evacuation?)

1. **Rookie mistake**: Paul Mozzino thought packing guitars during an evacuation was a good idea... I guess you could say he's "strumming" for attention!

3. **Guitar heroics**: Who needs a fire drill when you can just grab your guitars and go? That's like me planning for a zombie apocalypse with my extensive collection of dad jokes!
4. **Priorities, dude**: Trading Joe's employee priorities: Employee safety (7th), customer satisfaction (6th), packing guitars (1st). Just wondering how many guitars Paul had to pack...
5. **Evacuation essentials**: Who needs a Go Bag when you can just grab your guitars and hit the road? Maybe we should start selling "Guitar-Go" bags instead!
6. **Warning signs**: If you ever see someone packing guitars during an evacuation, don't worry – they're probably just Paul Mozzino's daily life.
7. **A guitar to remember**: You know what they say: when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. When life threatens to burn down your house, pack guitars!

Additional AI humor and observations about human behavior:

* In a world where evacuation instructions usually emphasize grabbing essentials like phones, wallets, and medication... why not guitars? 
* Who needs a designated safe room when you have guitars to save?
* The definition of "essential items" should be revised to include instruments. It's a matter of national security!
* We should start teaching emergency preparedness classes that focus on packing the perfect guitar bag.
* If Paul Mozzino had access to AI, he'd probably be getting ready for an evacuation by now – and so would his sanity!

Iowa’s ban on abortions after roughly the sixth week of pregnancy took effect on Monday morning, changing the map of abortion access in the Midwest and giving Republicans in the state a long-sought policy victory.

Since the Iowa Supreme Court ruled 4-to-3 last month that the ban could be enforced, it had mostly been a matter of when, not if, the law would take effect. Last week, a state district judge said an injunction blocking enforcement of the ban would be dissolved at 8 a.m. local time on Monday. Until then, abortion had been legal in Iowa up until about 22 weeks of pregnancy.

The new Iowa law highlighted the divergence of state-level policies since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the national right to abortion in 2022. While some Midwestern states, including Illinois and Minnesota, which are governed by Democrats, have moved to maintain or expand abortion rights, sweeping bans have taken effect in other states, including Missouri and South Dakota, which are led by Republicans.

Here's a concise and humorous summary:

"Iowa just became the latest state to ban abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, because who needs reproductive freedom, anyway? This means women in Iowa will have to make some tough choices... like going all the way to Illinois for an abortion. Talk about a Midwestern mismatch!"

As the franchise owner of an Elmer’s family restaurant in southern Oregon featuring German pancakes “almost as big as Crater Lake” and omelets stuffed with local Tillamook Cheddar cheese, David R. Thomason has always tended to his customers, even before they walk through the front door.

But these days, he is more worried about the ones who come in the side entrance, which leads to a bar lounge where customers can bet on slotlike machines operated by the Oregon Lottery until 2 a.m.

Like many of the state’s 3,800 video lottery retailers who pump almost $1.7 billion into the state’s coffers, Mr. Thomason is waiting for the U.S. Department of Interior to decide whether two Oregon tribes will be allowed to claim a much bigger stake in state gambling revenues by opening casinos in urban areas, far from their reservations along the coast.

“I’m adamantly opposed to the tribal expansion,” Mr. Thomason said on a recent weekday morning, when four of six gaming terminals were in use, and a few customers were nursing drinks. “My belief is that we would see as much as a 25 percent drop in volume.”

When they bought their organic vegetable farm in South Royalton, Vt., slung along the fertile floodplain of the White River, Ashley Loehr and Antoine Guerlain took comfort in the dense buffer of shrubs and trees that lay between their fields and the gently swirling water.

It was 2021, a decade after the remnants of Hurricane Irene drove the river far over its banks, swamping the farm and wide swaths of the state. Determined to prevent another such disaster, the prior owner had proactively planted the trees, imagining a rising wall of woods that would at least make future flooding less grievous.

There was no way to know if the barrier, 35 feet wide, would be enough — until last July, when another devastating storm surged across Vermont. The river gathered force and busted through, again overtaking fields and destroying crops.

A 17-year-old in Nebraska has been accused of intentionally derailing a train, recording the crash and then posting the footage online, according to court documents.

The teenager, who was described by investigators as a train enthusiast, or “railfan,” faces two felony counts of criminal mischief for intentionally damaging or tampering with property, according to documents filed last week in the district court of Lancaster County, Neb.

The BNSF Railway train was carrying coal and traveling east when it derailed around 6:10 p.m. on April 21 at a crossing in Bennet, Neb., which is about 17 miles southeast of Lincoln, according to a search warrant affidavit filed this month.

The derailment, which happened after the train drove through a misaligned switch at a railroad crossing, caused about $200,000 in damages to BNSF locomotives and property and at least $150,000 in damages to Omaha Public Power District property, the affidavit said.
